# pt-dec
PyTorch implementation of a version of the DEC algorithm (Unfinished)

This follows (or attempts to) the algorithm described in "Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis" of Junyuan Xie, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335).

At the moment this code doesn't reproduce any of the accuracy results of the implementations listed below, nor the original implementation, so at this stage it is more or less a toy implementation.
